# Doors closed

Makes villagers close doors more aggressively.

In vanilla, Villagers have a tendency to leave doors open for a variety of reasons, but will then never seek to close them.

## Changes
- Villagers that go though an already-open door will now close it afterward.
- Fixes an issue that gives villagers a random chance of not closing a door they went through, even if it was closed when they found it.
